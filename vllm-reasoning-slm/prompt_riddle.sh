Show your work clearly, explaining the logical deductions you make to move from the premises to the conclusion. Do not skip any steps. This section must be thorough. 3.  **Final Conclusion:** Finally, after your reasoning is complete, state the final answer clearly and concisely. Begin this section with: Therefore, the final answer is:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>


241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses
Given a string expression of numbers and operators, return all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators. You may return the answer in any order.
The test cases are generated such that the output values fit in a 32-bit integer and the number of different results does not exceed 10^4.
